# 🕵️‍♂️ Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 🚀 Project Summary

This project is focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques, with a strong emphasis on working with **imbalanced datasets**, applying **scaling**, **normalization**, and understanding the **decision-making process** of classifiers like **SVM** and **Decision Trees**.

> 🧠 This isn't just a model — it's a whole journey through real-world ML workflow, from raw data to confident fraud predictions.

## 📚 What I Learned
 **📊 Dataset Exploration & Preprocessing**
- Worked with a real-world dataset containing anonymized credit card transactions.
- Found that class imbalance was extreme (~0.17% fraud).
- Learned to use `.value_counts()` to get class distribution.
- Understood the importance of preprocessing using:
  - `StandardScaler()` for feature scaling
  - `normalize(..., norm='l1')` to scale rows to sum to 1
